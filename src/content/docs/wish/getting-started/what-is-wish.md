wish is the OAuth Sails hook you wish(pun intended) exists for Sails. wish provides a simple, convenient way to authenticate with OAuth providers. wish currently supports authentication via GitHub

## Motivation
When building [sailscasts](https://sailscasts.com), I needed an OAuth flow for GitHub. This hook is a byproduct of how OAuth is used in Sailscasts and it's targetted to not letting you reinvent the wheel and just use this hooks when you want to support OAuth in your Sails applications.
