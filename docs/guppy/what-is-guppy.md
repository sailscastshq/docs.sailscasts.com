guppy is a JavaScript code runner for Windows, macOS and Linux that allows you to immediately run JavaScript code. You can use it as a scratchpad to quickly execute JavaScript code or connect to your existing [Sails](https://sailsjs.com) applications and run code in their context.

Open any local Sails folder and guppy bootstraps your application and executes your Javascript code in your application.

If you ever wanted to quickly run a Sails Waterline query on your database – guppy is the way to go.

To learn more about guppy and get your license, check out the [official website](https://guppy.sailscasts.com) (it's bespoke ✨).
