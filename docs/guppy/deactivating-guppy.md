If you have a valid guppy license and you have activated guppy on 2 computers already and you want to use the app on another computer, you first have to deactivate guppy on one of those computers it is currently running on.

::: warning
Do well to deactivate guppy before uninstalling it on your computer so as to free up the license to be used on other computers you own.
