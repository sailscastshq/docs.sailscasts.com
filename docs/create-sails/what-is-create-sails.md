# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

An easy way to start a modern full-stack Sails project.

## Motivation

We all love the feeling of an SPA but the SPA/frontend JavaScript ecosytem is not without it's drawback with the vast tooling it needs.

create-sails aims to simplify building rich SPA with Sails powering it all.

With the create-sails scaffolding tool you can simplify creating SPAs with a single command `npx create-sails <project-name>` and then pick your frontend framework - Vue, React or Svelte - and you'd be on your way to creating a modern monolith with access to Sails.js routing, policies and data from Waterline you've come to love.
