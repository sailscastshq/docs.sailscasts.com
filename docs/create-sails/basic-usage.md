## What you will get with this scaffolding:

- [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com) powered by [inertia-sails](https://github.com/sailscastshq/inertia-sails)
- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org)
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org)

## Configuration

This scaffolding uses Webpack 5 for managing your Frontend assets. This is done via a project level hook called `webpack` which you can find in `config/webpack.js`. You can edit this file if you are familiar with Webpack or you want something more custom. But out of the box this should be good to go for 90% of projects
