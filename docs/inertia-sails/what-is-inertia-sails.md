# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

inertia-sails is the Sails adapter for Inertia.

## Motivation

We all love the feeling of an SPA but the SPA/frontend JavaScript ecosytem is not without it's drawback with the vast tooling it needs.

inertia-sails is an [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com) server-side adapter that aims to simplify building rich SPA with Sails.

With inertia-sails you get all the benefits of a modern SPA without needing a Sails API and decoupling the fronend from your backend in separate repos or monorepo.
