## Backend

The quickest way to get setup an Inertia powered Sails app is to use the [create-sails](https://github.com/sailscastshq/create-sails) scaffolding tool. Just run

```sh
  npx create-sails <project-name>
```

::: info
Do replace `<project-name>` with the name you want your project to be.

## Frontend

If you are using the [create-sails](https://github.com/sailscastshq/create-sails) scaffolding tool then the Frontend framework you choose from the CLI prompt should already be setup for you.
