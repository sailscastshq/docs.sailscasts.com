# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

captain-vane is a Sails hook that allows you generate realistically test data for a Sails application.

## Motivation

When building apps or testing it, coming up with a bunch of "Lorem ipsum" style data or one of those "John Doe" for test user name is not quite realistic. captain-vane provides a rich factory system for your models and a single helper `vane` that let's you quickly generate realistic fake data.
