# Getting started

To get started with The Boring JavaScript Stack, use `create-sails` â€” a CLI tool that scaffolds a new Sails project, configured as a full-stack JavaScript application with The Boring Stack conventions:

::: code-group

```sh [Vue]
npx create-sails project-name --vue
```

```sh [React]
npx create-sails project-name --react
```

```sh [Svelte]
npx create-sails project-name --svelte
```

:::

::: info
Make sure to replace `project-name` with the name of your project.
:::

Then `cd` into your project and run `npm i`:

```sh
cd project-name && npm i
```

## Start your app

To start you app simply run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

::: info sails lift
You can also run your app with `npx sails l`.
:::

## What's next?

For next steps, you have two options:

1. Open your project in your code editor and explore.
2. Begin by learning the basics, such as [routing](/boring-stack/routing) and [navigation](/boring-stack/navigation).

::: info Sailboat VS Code extension
Install the [Sailboat extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dominuskelvin.sailboat) which provides tooling for Sails.
