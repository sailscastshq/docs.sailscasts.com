# Deploy on Slipway

This page covers deploying a Boring Stack app on [Slipway](https://github.com/sailscastshq/slipway).

::: tip Recommended for self-hosting
Slipway is the recommended self-hosting option in these docs. It detects the app's Sails setup, Dockerfile, database, and Redis configuration.

It also provides push-to-deploy, automatic SSL, preview environments, database management, and background job monitoring on the same server.
:::

## Install Slipway

Run the install script on your server (a VPS, dedicated server, or any Linux machine with Docker):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sailscastshq/slipway/main/install.sh | bash
```

Once installed, open your Slipway dashboard and complete the setup wizard.

::: info
See the full [server installation guide](/slipway/server-installation) and [system requirements](/slipway/requirements) in the Slipway docs.
:::

## Create a project

In your Slipway dashboard, [create a new project](/slipway/creating-projects). This gives you a production environment and a place to manage your app's deployments, services, and domains.

## Follow the deployment checklist

Once your project is created, link it to your local codebase using the Slipway CLI:

```bash
slipway link <project>
```

Slipway reads your app's `package.json` and generates a **deployment checklist** tailored to your app. It detects what your app actually needs and tells you exactly what's missing:

- **Database required** — Slipway sees `sails-postgresql` (or `sails-mysql`, `sails-mongo`) in your dependencies and warns you if no database service is running
- **Redis required** — Slipway detects `@sailshq/connect-redis` and warns you if Redis isn't set up for session storage
- **SESSION_SECRET missing** — warns you if your app doesn't have a secure session secret, with a one-click **Generate** button to create one

Each checklist item comes with an actionable button — **Add database**, **Add Redis**, **Generate** — so you can fix issues directly from the checklist without hunting through settings. Once everything is configured, the checklist shows a green "Environment is configured correctly" status.

::: tip Deployment checklist
Slipway inspects the app and reports missing services or environment variables so you can fix them from the checklist.
:::

## Connect your GitHub repo

1. Go to **Settings > Git** and connect your GitHub account
2. Navigate to your project's app settings and click **Connect Repository**
3. Select the repository containing your Boring Stack app
4. Choose the branch to deploy from (e.g. `main`)

Once connected, Slipway generates a deploy key and webhook automatically — every push to your configured branch triggers a deployment.

::: info
See the [Git integration guide](/slipway/git-integration) and [auto-deploy](/slipway/auto-deploy) docs for more details on push-to-deploy configuration.
:::

## Add a database

In your project's environment, click **Add Service** and select the database you need. Slipway supports [PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB](/slipway/database-services) as one-click services.

::: tip Automatic `DATABASE_URL`
When you create a database service, Slipway automatically sets `DATABASE_URL` as an environment variable on the app.
:::

## Add Redis

Click **Add Service** and select **Redis**. Slipway creates a Redis container and automatically injects `REDIS_URL` into your app's environment.

## Set up database adapter

Depending on the database you chose, [set up that adapter](/boring-stack/database) in `config/env/production.js`:

::: code-group

```js [PostgreSQL]
module.exports = {
  datastores: {
    default: {
      adapter: 'sails-postgresql',
      url: process.env.DATABASE_URL
    }
  }
}
```

```js [MySQL]
module.exports = {
  datastores: {
    default: {
      adapter: 'sails-mysql',
      url: process.env.DATABASE_URL
    }
  }
}
```

```js [MongoDB]
module.exports = {
  datastores: {
    default: {
      adapter: 'sails-mongo',
      url: process.env.DATABASE_URL
    }
  }
}
```

:::

::: warning
Don't forget to install the adapter if you haven't already. See the [database](/boring-stack/database) docs for more info.
:::

## Set up Redis

Set up the Redis adapter in `config/env/production.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  session: {
    secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,
    adapter: '@sailshq/connect-redis',
    url: process.env.REDIS_URL
  }
}
```

## Set environment variables

Add any additional environment variables your app needs. You can set them in two places:

- **Environment page** — in your project's environment settings, manage all env vars for that environment
- **App settings** — set app-specific env vars that override environment-level ones

The only variable you need to add manually is:

- `SESSION_SECRET`: A unique production session secret to override the one in `config/session.js`

::: info
`DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL` are already set automatically when you created the database and Redis services. See the [environment variables guide](/slipway/environment-variables) for more on how Slipway manages env vars.
:::

::: info Additional environment variables
Depending on the template you're using, you may need to set additional environment variables. For example, the [Ascent template](/boring-stack/ascent) requires additional configuration for authentication, teams, and billing features.
:::

## Set up a custom domain

In your environment settings, add your [custom domain](/slipway/custom-domain). Slipway handles SSL certificates automatically via Caddy — your app will be served over HTTPS with zero configuration.

## Deploy

Push to your configured branch and Slipway takes care of the rest — it clones your repo, builds the Docker image from your Dockerfile, runs health checks, and switches traffic with zero downtime.

You can also trigger a deployment manually from the dashboard or with the [Slipway CLI](/slipway/deploy-command):

```bash
slipway slide
```

::: tip Dockerfile included
The Boring Stack templates come with a production-ready Dockerfile, so you don't need to create one manually. Slipway detects and uses it automatically.
:::

After the build finishes, Slipway deploys the app to the configured domain.

## What you get with Slipway

Slipway also provides operational tools for the deployed app:

- **[Push-to-deploy](/slipway/auto-deploy)** — automatic deployments from GitHub on every push
- **[Preview environments](/slipway/auto-deploy)** — automatic environments for pull requests
- **[Custom domains & SSL](/slipway/custom-domain)** — HTTPS via Caddy with automatic certificate management
- **[Helm](/slipway/helm)** — a production REPL to query your Waterline models and run helpers live
- **[Bridge](/slipway/bridge)** — an auto-generated admin interface for browsing and editing your data
- **[Dock](/slipway/dock)** — a database management console with SQL editor, table browser, and migrations
- **[Quest](/slipway/quest)** — monitor and manage your sails-hook-quest background jobs

- **[Lookout](/slipway/lookout)** — real-time observability with request tracing, exceptions, and metrics
- **[Rollbacks](/slipway/rollbacks)** — one-click rollback to any previous deployment
- **[Notifications](/slipway/notifications)** — get alerted on deployment status, container issues, and more
