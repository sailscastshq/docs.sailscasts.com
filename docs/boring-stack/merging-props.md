Inertia, by default, replaces props with identical names when a page reloads. However, in scenarios like pagination or infinite scrolling, this behavior might not be ideal. To address this, you can opt to merge props rather than overwrite them.

## Server side

To ensure that a prop is merged rather than overwritten, use the `sails.inertia.merge()` method on the prop value. This method signals Inertia to combine the new data with the existing data, which is particularly useful for scenarios like pagination or infinite scrolling.

```js
module.exports = {
  inputs: {
    page: {
      type: 'number',
      defaultsTo: 0
    },
    perPage: {
      type: 'number',
      defaultsTo: 10
    }
  },
  exits: {
    success: {
      responseType: 'inertia'
    }
  },
  fn: async function ({ page }) {
    const servers = await Server.find({ isRunning: true }).paginate(
      page,
      perPage
    )
    return {
      page: 'servers',
      props: { servers: sails.inertia.merge(() => servers) }
    }
  }
}
```

On the client side, Inertia automatically detects when a prop should be merged. If the prop is an array, the new data will be appended to the existing array. If the prop is an object, the new data will be merged with the existing object.

Additionally, you can combine [deferred props](/boring-stack/deferred-props) with mergeable props. This allows you to defer the loading of a prop and mark it as mergeable once it has been loaded.

```js
module.exports = {
  inputs: {
    page: {
      type: 'number',
      defaultsTo: 0
    },
    perPage: {
      type: 'number',
      defaultsTo: 10
    }
  },
  exits: {
    success: {
      responseType: 'inertia'
    }
  },
  fn: async function ({ page }) {
    const servers = sails.inertia.defer(
      async () => await Server.find({ isRunning: true }).paginate(page, perPage)
    )
    return {
      page: 'servers',
      props: { servers: sails.inertia.merge(() => servers) }
    }
  }
}
```

## Resetting props

On the client side, you can instruct the server to reset a prop. This is useful when you need to clear the prop value before merging new data, such as when a user enters a new search query in a paginated list.

The reset request option accepts an array of prop keys that you want to reset.

```js
router.reload({
  reset: ['servers']
})
```
