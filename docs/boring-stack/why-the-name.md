# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

The JavaScript ecosystem is too exciting - we are always coming up with newer ways to build web software.

I don't know about you but one of the reasons why I opted to based my career in web development on JavaScript was to build things quickly and easily.

But with the constant state of chasing the next trend or reinventing the wheel or in most cases ignoring the wheel ever existed, we've been busy glorifying our hammers ‚öíÔ∏è instead of building amazing things with it.

## Boring technology

We don't build web software in a vacuum, we do it to solve problems in our place of work, build an MVP of that killer idea, etc.

There are so many exciting problems to be solved with web software that it begs the question: Why are we wasting time and resources building what to build with?

There exist amazing technologies that have been tried and tested that you can depend on.

There is a school of thought that called tried, tested, stable technologies, boring tech and The Boring JavaScript Stack is a tribute to that school of thought and a contrarian movement against the trend in the JS ecosystem of chasing the shiny.

With The Boring JavaScript Stack you can get off the rat race and move fast by building with stable and boring technologies.

## Boring is good

Someone once expressed concerns with the name - The Boring JavaScript Stack. Their concern is that "...many will still get scared of the name".

The fact that many will get scared of the name sort of prove my point of glorifying the hammer and not the building. I think it's focusing on the wrong things.

We've got to stop getting excited about tools and start getting excited about the problems we are solving with them.

Boring technologies are...

- stable
- tried
- tested
- stable
- predictable

## Boring is good for business

I'm pretty sure when you solve problems via web software in your business that you are not in the business of burning through tools to build your solution with.

## Solve exciting problems

Want excitements? Who doesn't üòÅ! Don't look to your tools for that excitement, look to the problems you are solving.

For example, [Lemon Squeezy](https://lemonsqueezy.com) using a flavor of The Boring JavaScript Stack(they use Laravel as the web framework not Sails), are busy solving the exciting problem of enabling creators receive payments on the internet.

In fact, the more boring your stack is the quicker you can let the tools fade in the background while you zoom in into the problems you are solving. Your tools are supposed to enable you to be awesome, not them being awesome in your eyes.
