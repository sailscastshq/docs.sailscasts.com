## Create database

Create the database you want to use for production on Railway and take note of the connection url.
::: info Database creation guides
See guides for [MySQL](https://docs.railway.com/guides/mysql), [PostgreSQL](https://docs.railway.com/guides/postgresql), and, [MongoDB](https://docs.railway.com/guides/mongodb) on the Railway docs.
:::

## Create Redis instance

Create the production Redis instance and take note of the connection url.
::: info Redis instance guide
See the [guide to create a Redis instance](https://docs.railway.com/guides/redis) on the Railway docs.
:::

## Set up database

Depending on the database you want to use for production, [set up that adapter](/boring-stack/database) in `config/environment/production.js`
::: code-group

```js [PostgreSQL]
module.exports = {
  datastores: {
    default: {
      adapter: 'sails-postgresql',
      url: process.env.DATABASE_URL
    }
  }
}
```

```js [MySQL]
module.exports = {
  datastores: {
    default: {
      adapter: 'sails-mysql',
      url: process.env.DATABASE_URL
    }
  }
}
```

```js [MongoDB]
module.exports = {
  datastores: {
    default: {
      adapter: 'sails-mongo',
      url: process.env.DATABASE_URL
    }
  }
}
```

:::

::: warning
Don't forget to install the adapter if you haven't already. See the [database](/boring-stack/database) docs for more info.
:::

## Set up Redis

::: info
[Create a new Redis instance](https://docs.railway.com/guides/redis) on Railway by following the Railway docs.
:::
Set up the Redis adapter in `config/environment/production.js`

```js
module.exports = {
  session: {
    secret: process.env.REDIS_SECRET
    adapter: '@sailshq/connect-redis',
    url: process.env.REDIS_URL
  }
}
```

## Create a web service

Create a new [Web Service](https://docs.railway.com/quick-start) on Railway, and give Railway permission to access the repo of your app.

If necessary, use the following values during creation:

- **Runtime**: `Node`
- **Build command**: `npm i`
- **Start command**: `npm start`

However, Railway is capable of configuring things automatically for you.

## Set environment variables

Add the following evironment variables to your web service:

- `DATABASE_URL`: This should point to the connection string of the database you created.
- `REDIS_URL`: This should point to the connection string to the Redis instance you created.
- `SESSION_SECRET`: A unique production session secret to override the one in `config/session.js`.

Thatâ€™s it! Your app will be live on your Railway URL as soon as the build finishes :tada:

## Celebrate with a :star:

::: tip Star The Boring JavaScript Stack repo on GitHub :star:
Let's celebrate deploying your app on Railway by giving **The Boring JavaScript Stack** [a star on GitHub](https://github.com/sailscastshq/boring-stack).
