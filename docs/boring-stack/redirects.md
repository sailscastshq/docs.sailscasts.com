## Route target redirect

You can set up one route to redirect to another route within your app or even to another absolute URL in your `config/routes.js`.

```js
module.exports.routes = {
  '/chat': '/community', // [!code focus]
  'GET /docs': 'https://docs.sailscasts.com' // [!code focus]
}
```

## Exit signal redirect

You can also set an exit to signal a redirect in your action.

```js
module.exports = {
  exits: {
    // [!code focus]
    success: {
      // [!code focus]
      responseType: 'redirect' // [!code focus]
    } // [!code focus]
  }, // [!code focus]
  fn: async function (inputs) {
    return '/' // [!code focus]
  }
}
```

Notice we set the `responseType` to `redirect` and then we can return a URL string.

## 303 response code for SPAs

When redirecting after a `PUT`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE` request from your SPA, you must use a `303` response code, otherwise the subsequent request will not be treated as a `GET` request. A `303` redirect is very similar to a `302` redirect; however, the follow-up request is explicitly changed to a `GET` request.

The Boring Stack provides you with a helper method to do that in your controller actions:

```js
return sails.inertia.location(url)
```

## External redirects

Sometimes it's necessary to redirect to an external website, or even another page in your app that's not an SPA. This can be accomplished using a server-side initiated `window.location` visit via the `sails.inertia.location()` method.

```js
return sails.inertia.location(url)
```

The `sails.inertia.location(url)` method will generate a `409` Conflict response if the redirect request is coming from a `POST` or `GET` method and include the destination URL in the `X-Inertia-Location` header. When this response is received client-side, Inertia will automatically perform a `window.location = url` visit.
